# web3-triathlete
This is itended to be a web3 product project starter including templates for a decentralized software product, governance and token engineering. I struggled for well over a year to put together everything needed to start a web3 product from scratch. At the beginning, I assumed that it would be similar to starting a Delware LLC for a web2 product. I was very mistaken. There are a lot of components involved in putting together a real web3 product, and not all of them are particularly well understood. I wanted to be able to run a script and have everything I needed to start hacking on a product that I could bring to market on the public blockchain. With no smoke and mirrors.

This repo is heavily indebted to two projects: API3 and Token Engineering Community. The intent is to combine a generalized model of a decentralized application, and API3 provided a great example. Their open source legal engineering was also crucial in putting this all together and wrapping it in a Cayman Islands entity. Projects from Token Engineering Community were also key including cadCAD and tokenSPICE.
